# Description
Personal whiteboard to visualize algorithms.

# About
Whilst practicing data structures and algorithms, I'm not really a fan of pen and paper especially with trying to visualize pointer or index movements in iterations & recursions, hence, this project. I'm starting off by building this with Vanilla JS then transition to React once I get a pretty solid picture of how I want the end UI to look like.
